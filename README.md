Bio

I am now founder of three ventures: DL Capital for private equity investment, HL Oriental for public equity investment and SDA Cambridge for affordable intelligent solutions distribution.

I have worked in the finance industry for about 15 years in Hong Kong, as an equity analyst for the first 5 years and then an investment manager for another 10 years. I have completed 23 private equity investments and also managed a portfolio of stocks with AUM of roughly USD 100m. Successfully exited deals include Dongyue (189.HK), Koolearn Tech, Miniso and Golden Harvest etc, with an accumulated distribution of over USD 100m paid to investors. I have also ever sited on the board of some investee companies such as Gogox and FJDynamics. 

I graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong University with a BEng and University of Hong Kong with a MPhil in Operations Research. I also received an executive MBA from Cambridge Judge Business School.

Outside of career, I have ever led a bicycle fundraising campaign from London to Cambridge for Clare Hall, Cambridge (https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/news/emba-student-steven-lu-raises-over-10000-for-diversity-and-inclusion/) and organied a trip to the Greater Bay Area of China for a delegation of EMBA students and staffs from Cambridge Judge Business School (https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2024/cambridge-embas-explore-innovation-in-chinas-greater-bay-area/). In addition, I have ever sitted as a selection committee for the zero-carbon innovation competition TERA-Award 2023 (https://tera-award.life/)
