Bio

I am the founder of three ventures: (1) DL Capital, specializing in private equity investment; (2) HL Oriental, focusing on public equity investment; and (3) SDA Cambridge, which distributes affordable intelligent solutions.

My 15-year tenure in the finance industry in Hong Kong includes roles as an equity analyst for the first five years, followed by a decade as an investment manager. I have executed 23 private equity investments and managed a stock portfolio with an AUM of approximately USD 100m. My successful exits include Dongyue (189.HK), Koolearn Tech, Miniso, and Golden Harvest, among others, resulting in over USD 100m distributed to investors. Additionally, I have served on the boards of investee companies such as Gogox and FJDynamics.

I hold a BEng from Xi'an Jiaotong University and an MPhil from the University of Hong Kong. I also earned an executive MBA from Cambridge Judge Business School. My academic interests lie in Math & Operations Research and I published journal papers about distributed optimization algorithm.

Beyond my professional life, I have led a bicycle fundraising campaign from London to Cambridge and organized a trip to China's Greater Bay Area for a delegation of 23 members from Cambridge Judge Business School. Furthermore, I have supported Cambridge University Library to receive a collection of documents about a social activist's life from 1970's to 1990's in China, and I also served on the selection committee for the zero-carbon innovation competition TERA-Award 2023.
